**Enhancements for the Rubric**
Pre-trained Model Integration:

The model architecture includes an optional parameter for pre-trained weights, enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning. If pre-trained weights are available, only the fully connected layer (fc) is trained.
Efficiency in Training:

Freezing the pre-trained LSTM layer reduces the number of trainable parameters, improving training speed and reducing computational costs.
Improved Workflow:

Uses DataLoader for efficient batch processing, improving training pipeline efficiency.
Implements torch.save for saving the model, enabling reusability and deployment.
